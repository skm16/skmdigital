## Site Structure (Single-Page Landing)

### Section 1: Hero
**Headline:** "Custom Technical Solutions for Modern Web Challenges"

**Subheadline:** "Multi-system integration. AI-powered automation. Modern web applications. Enterprise WordPress. We build whatever your client needs—not just what fits in a CMS."

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "Start a Project"
- Secondary: "View Case Studies"

**Visual:** Clean code editor or abstract tech (NOT generic stock photos)

---

### Section 2: The Problem
**Headline:** "Your Client Expects Innovation. Your Team Delivers Templates."

**3 Pain Points:**

**🔗 Complex Integration**
Your client needs their website to talk to Salesforce, process payments through Stripe, and sync data in real-time. Your team's integration experience stops at contact form plugins.

**🤖 AI Capabilities**
They want ChatGPT-powered features, intelligent content generation, and automated workflows. You're not sure if that's even possible in WordPress—or if WordPress is even the right choice.

**⚡ Modern Architecture**
They're expecting headless WordPress with Next.js frontend, handling enterprise-scale traffic. Your developers are comfortable with page builders and themes.

**Transition:** "You win the client. We handle the technical complexity. They think it's all you."

---

### Section 3: The Solution
**Headline:** "Your White-Label Technical Partner"

**Body:**
We're not another dev shop with one solution for every problem. We're specialists who choose the right technology stack for each challenge—whether that's WordPress with complex integrations, a modern Next.js application, AI-powered automation, or a combination of all three.

**What Makes Us Different:**
- **7+ years** building enterprise-scale solutions for national organizations
- **Multi-platform expertise** - WordPress, Next.js, React, headless architectures
- **Production AI deployment** - OpenAI/Anthropic integration in mission-critical systems
- **Proven at scale** - 1M+ monthly visitor platforms, zero-downtime deployments

## Content Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Professional but approachable** - not corporate, not casual
- **Confident without arrogance** - "we've built this" not "we're the best"
- **Technical but accessible** - explain complexity without jargon overload
- **Results-focused** - emphasize business outcomes, not just tech specs

### Writing Style
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Active voice ("We build..." not "Solutions are built...")
- Specific numbers when possible ("15+ hours saved" not "significant time savings")
- No buzzwords without context (don't just say "synergy" or "revolutionary")

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Generic stock phrases ("leverage cutting-edge solutions")
- ❌ Over-promising ("we can build anything")
- ❌ Negative comparison ("unlike other developers who...")
- ❌ Excessive technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Humble-bragging ("we're just a small team but...")

### What to Emphasize
- ✅ Concrete results with numbers
- ✅ Real project examples
- ✅ Technical capabilities demonstrated through case studies
- ✅ White-label partnership (invisibility as a feature)
- ✅ Multi-platform flexibility (not locked to one tool)

---

## Key Messaging Points

### Primary Differentiators

1. **Multi-Platform Expertise**
   - Not just WordPress - Next.js, React, custom apps
   - Choose right tool for problem, not force-fit one solution
   - Demonstrate through case studies (WordPress project + Next.js project)

2. **Production AI Integration**
   - Not experimenting - deployed for 5+ years
   - Real business value (400 hours saved, 95% accuracy)
   - OpenAI AND Anthropic (show depth beyond ChatGPT)

3. **Enterprise Integrations**
   - Multi-system orchestration (3+ platforms)
   - Financial data handling (PCI compliance, payment sync)
   - Proven reliability (zero critical failures)

4. **White Label Philosophy**
   - Not competing with agencies for clients
   - Invisibility as core feature
   - Agency maintains relationship and margins

### Objection Handling

**Objection:** "We already have WordPress developers"  
**Response:** "We're not replacing your WordPress team—we handle the complex integrations, AI features, and modern architectures they can't. Your developers focus on content and design, we handle the technical heavy lifting."

**Objection:** "Isn't WordPress outdated?"  
**Response:** "WordPress powers 43% of the web, but we're not limited to it. We build Next.js applications, headless architectures, and custom platforms. WordPress is one tool in our stack—we use it when it's the right fit, and build custom when it's not."

**Objection:** "Can you handle [specific technology]?"  
**Response:** "If it's in our service list (WordPress, Next.js, AI, Salesforce, etc.), yes absolutely. If it's outside our core expertise, we'll tell you honestly rather than learning on your project."

**Objection:** "What if our client finds out we outsourced?"  
**Response:** "White label is our default, not an option. We never contact your clients directly, never appear in source code comments, and can sign NDAs. In 7 years, zero clients have discovered our partnerships because we're built for invisibility."
